**Introduction:**
Databases play a pivotal role in modern society, managing vast amounts of data across various domains. While SQL is a common language for database management, leveraging C++ for database maintenance offers unique advantages. In this post, we'll explore implementing a database system using text files, storing essential student information such as registration numbers, names, marks in specific courses, and proctor IDs.

**Key Components:**
1. **Data Storage:** The database stores student data in a structured format within a text file. Each record includes registration numbers, names, course marks, and proctor IDs.
2. **User Views:** Different user roles (e.g., students, faculty, proctors, administrators) have distinct views of the database. Users interact with the system through a command-line interface, accessing specific functionalities based on their roles.
3. **Functionalities:**
   - **Add New Students:** Users can add new student records to the database, providing necessary details such as registration numbers, names, and proctor IDs.
   - **Student Login:** Students can access their individual records by entering their registration numbers, viewing their personal information and course marks.
   - **Faculty Login:** Faculty members have access to student records and can view course marks for specific subjects.
   - **Proctor Login:** Proctors oversee a group of students and can view and edit records for students under their supervision.
   - **Admin View:** Administrators have comprehensive access to the entire database, allowing them to view, edit, and manage all records.
4. **Editing Functionality:** Users with appropriate privileges can edit existing records, enabling updates to student information or course marks as necessary.

**Implementation Details:**
1. **File Handling:** C++ facilitates file handling operations to read from and write to text files containing student records.
2. **User Authentication:** The system authenticates users based on their roles and provides corresponding views and functionalities.
3. **User Input Handling:** Input mechanisms prompt users for required information, ensuring accurate data entry and interaction.
4. **Data Manipulation:** The system supports various operations such as adding, viewing, and editing student records, ensuring the integrity and security of the database.
